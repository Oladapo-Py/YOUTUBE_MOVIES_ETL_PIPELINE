# YouTube ETL Pipeline Project

A data engineering pipeline that performs **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** operations on a real YouTube dataset using **Python**, **Pandas**, and **AWS S3**. This project was designed to demonstrate fundamental data engineering skills relevant to job descriptions that involve ETL/ELT, cloud technologies, and Python scripting.

## üöÄ What This Project Covers

- Building an ETL pipeline with Python
- Using virtual environments and `pip`
- Reading and transforming CSV data with `pandas`
- Uploading files to AWS S3 using `boto3`
- Organizing code in a modular way
- Running the ETL process via a single script (`main.py`)
- Creating a `requirements.txt` for dependency tracking

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas
- AWS S3
- Boto3
- VS Code (IDE)
- PowerShell (on Windows)
- Virtual Environments
